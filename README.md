# Full Stack Car Dealerships App

## üìù  Background

This application represents the penultimate milestone in the Full-Stack Software Developer certification program offered by IBM. Built on a core framework provided by the IBM team, which initially lacked functionality and predefined templates, this project was transformed into a comprehensive platform. The skills learned and practiced in 10 courses by the IBM team are presented in this project, which consists of several programming languages and a backend framework. The application serves as a platform for dealership users offering them to engage with dealership-related details and reviews. Its backbone relies heavily on a REST API for seamless communication and integration, ensuring efficient data management and retrieval. This project stands as a testament to the knowledge, expertise, and dedication fostered within the IBM certification program, exemplifying the practical application of acquired skills in real-world scenarios.
